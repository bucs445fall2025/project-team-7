Complete and finalize SRS document to align the project scope.

### Requirement Target

Complete testing between backend and frontend (API endpoints for login, signup, item listing).

Build the main homepage UI.

Finalize and submit SRS draft.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to see a list of items available for borrowing on the homepage.

As a user, I want to log in from the frontend and access my data from the backend.

### Planning

Create and style the main page (item listings).

Draft and review the SRS document for all core requirements.

### Action Items

Build homepage layout and connect to item data.

Write SRS sections: introduction, system overview, functional/non-functional requirements.
