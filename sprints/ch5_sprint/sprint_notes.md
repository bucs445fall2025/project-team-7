## Sprint Planning

## Requirements Flex

2/3 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt

Need to test backendâ€“frontend integration from previous sprint.
Complete and finalize SRS document to align the project scope.

### Requirement Target

Complete testing between backend and frontend (API endpoints for login, signup, item listing).

Build the main homepage UI.

Finalize and submit SRS draft.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to see a list of items available for borrowing on the homepage.

As a user, I want to log in from the frontend and access my data from the backend.

### Planning

Create and style the main page (item listings).

Draft and review the SRS document for all core requirements.

### Action Items

Build homepage layout and connect to item data.

Write SRS sections: introduction, system overview, functional/non-functional requirements.

Test database CRUD operations through Prisma.

### Issues and Risks

Integration challenges between backend and frontend (CORS, auth token handling).

Possible delays if database schema requires changes after integration.

Risk of misalignment between SRS and implementation if not completed soon.
