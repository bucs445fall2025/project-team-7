## Sprint Planning

## Requirements Flex
- For this sprint, we focused on implementing the main page mapping integration and UI layout foundation.
Some secondary features such as chat functionality and request handling UI will be initiated but not fully completed.
Backend integration will focus on API endpoints required for the mapping feature.

## Technical Debt
-

### Requirement Target
Design mainpage with categories, chat buttons, 

Integrate map display and interaction on the main page.

Connect map to backend to fetch and display items by location.

Build main page UI skeleton with placeholder components for “Chat” button.

Ensure frontend-backend communication works for item data retrieval.

### User Stories
As a user, I want to view dropdown menu when I enter the mainpage.

As a user, I want buttons to send requests or open chat windows for items directly from the main page.

### Planning
Come up with mainpage layout with requests, categories, etc.

Create button on mainpage for importing feature. 

Design and implement main page layout in React with buttons for items, requests, and chat.

Connect mainpage to backend. 

Prepare UI components for chat and borrow request flow for next sprint expansion

### Action Items
 Create backend route for retrieving item coordinates.

 Build base main page layout with placeholders for future modules.

 Start styling buttons and sections for request/chat.

### Issues and Risks
Risk of merge conflicts due to simultaneous frontend and backend edits.

Dependencies between UI layout and backend API endpoints may slow integration testing.

Time allocation challenges for balancing new feature work with bug fixes.
