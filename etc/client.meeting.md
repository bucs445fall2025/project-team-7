### **Interview Questions & Responses**

#### **1. What are the costs vs. budget?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "I don’t want to spend much, ideally free, but I’d consider paying a one-time fee.")
I don't have that much to pay in hourly basis. I want it to be self-funding project. I have around $1000 left-over in my own bank account but I would rather not use it.

**Clarification & Notes:**
(Example: The client is looking for a free tool but may accept optional paid features.)
The client is looking for a tool that can be created for free or within $1000.

#### **2. What is the timeframe for this project?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "I need this ready before my next campaign starts in three months.")
I’d ideally like to have a working prototype or alpha version ready by the time it reaches spring break and a fully functioning app by the end of my time at Binghamton University. 

**Clarification & Notes:**
(Example: A strict deadline, must focus on core features first.)
Must be done by spring break.

#### **3. What problem are you trying to solve?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Managing initiative order and tracking actions is too slow.")
I'm trying to make people’s lives easier and do some communal good before I leave college. However, I wouldn’t mind making some money, too. 

**Clarification & Notes:**
- The real problem is **speed and efficiency** during gameplay, not just "initiative tracking."
- Consider features like **automation** and **UI improvements** to streamline this.
The main problem is to save money from purchasing items for single use.
Consider features like a map, a chatting area, etc.

#### **4. What is the most important feature?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Initiative tracking needs to be easy and automatic.")
I think just being able to find people who are willing to lend.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- This feature should be the **core focus** of the software.
- Other features (e.g., dice rolling) are secondary.
Matching people who want to borrow an item with those who are willing to lend, and a search feature for the borrowers to find lenders easily.

#### **5. Is there a similar product on the market?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "Yes, but they are either too complex or too expensive.")
Maybe in other schools? None that I've seen that is useful.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Competitor analysis needed.
- Find a way to differentiate: **Simpler UI? Free version? Customizable?**

---

#### **6. Are there any existing products or technologies that will need to be integrated?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "It would be nice if it worked with Roll20 or D&D Beyond.")
I think that gps tracking might be needed? I think thats it.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Check for **APIs** for possible integrations.
- Consider a **manual import/export** feature if full integration isn’t feasible.

#### **7. What does success look like for this project?**
**Client’s Response:**
(Example: "If my players can see whose turn it is without me saying anything, that’s a win.")

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Focus on **visual clarity and notifications**.

---

#### **8. What risks are associated with a malicious user?**

#### **9. What is the expected lifetime of this software?**

(Example: "I want to use it for many campaigns, so it should last for years.")

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Future **maintenance and updates** should be considered.

---

#### **10. What additional features would you like?**

(Example: "A way to send private messages to players would be cool.")
